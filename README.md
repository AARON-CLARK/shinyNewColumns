`shinyNewColumns` is a shiny module used to derive custom columns in R
data.frames on the fly. The module simply produces one small UI element:
an action button titled ‘Create New Column’ that can be placed anywhere
in an existing shiny application. Upon clicking, a modal containing a
user-friendly interface will launch & allow the user to build a new
column off an existing data source. Specifically, the user will be able
to select a new column type, name, label, and reference column(s) during
derivation. Along the way, the module helps the user visualize existing
column’s distributions and summaries. Upon completion, the module
returns the supplied data frame with the new column appended, and
optional the `dplyr::mutate()` expressions used to create said column.

## Shiny Conf 2022

The `shinyNewColumns` shiny module was presented as a featured tutorial
for the first annual Appsilon Shiny Conference in April of 2022. The
subject of the tutorial was on “**Evaluating user inputs from
dynamically produced UI modules**”. With time, Appsilon will post the
tutorial’s recording to their
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6LqpR5qBfNlQp5mVIVsthA)
channel. In the meantime, feel free to checkout the presentation slide
deck
[here](https://github.com/AARON-CLARK/shinyNewColumns/tree/master/inst/example/shinyconf%20tutorial).
Enjoy and please feel free to reach out with any questions by
[submitting an
issue](https://github.com/AARON-CLARK/shinyNewColumns/issues) to the
repo.

## Installation

You can install the current development version of `shinyNewColumns`
from [GitHub](https://github.com/AARON-CLARK/shinyNewColumns) using:

``` r
remotes::install_github("AARON-CLARK/shinyNewColumns")
```

## Example App

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(shinyNewColumns)
library(shiny)
library(DT)

ui <- fluidPage(
    h1("shinyNewColumns" , align = "center"),
    br(), br(),
    # just a button...
    fluidRow(column(12, align = "center", mod_launchModal_ui("snc"))),
    br(),
    h3("New column's code:"),
    h4("(generated by user inputs)"),
    verbatimTextOutput("display_expr"),
    br(),
    h3("Iris data:"),
    wellPanel(dataTableOutput("display_data"))
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  out <- mod_launchModal_srv("snc", dat = iris)
  output$display_expr <- renderPrint(out$expr())
  output$display_data <- renderDataTable(out$data())
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
